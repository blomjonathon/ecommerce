# ecommerce app
## Description
### This app uses sequalize and mysql2 node packages to be able to create a database with models, as well as seed the data for testing in postman and other uses. The functionality mainly sets up the routes to perfom all CRUD functions. I am going to cite Chat GPT because I relied heavily on it for this project: OpenAI. (2024).
